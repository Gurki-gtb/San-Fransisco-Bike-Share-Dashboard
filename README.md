## ðŸ˜Ž What I learned 
- Blending multiple data sources through primary keys and foreign keys
- Using parameters and calculated fields to create custom controls for interaction
- Creating calculated field to simulate logic

## ðŸ’¡ Reflection 
This was one of my first advanced dashboard looker projects, this was a big step forward in building clean user friendly dashboard. The usage of blends and parameters was the biggest difference in this dashboard compared to the others. Give me the ugly data and I'll make it something anyone can understand! ðŸ˜Ž
